Django Application

from django.http import JsonResponse 
JsonResponse converts the data (usually a dictionary or list) into JSON format and returns it in the HTTP response. It's commonly used for API responses.

from django.db import transaction
transaction.atomic() ensures that the registration and participant limit update happen together as a single operation. If one fails, both actions are rolled back, preventing inconsistent database states and race conditions.

In this case, a race condition can occur if two users attempt to register for the same event at the same time. 


get_object_or_404: Retrieves an object from the database based on the given model and criteria. If the object is not found, it raises a 404 Not Found error, making it useful for handling missing resources in views.

from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, get_user_model
user = authenticate(email=email, password=password)
authenticate: Used to verify a user's credentials (username and password). It returns the user object if credentials are valid, or None if they are invalid.

get_user_model() is used to get the user model defined in the project, whether it's the default Django user model or a custom one.


default_storage provides an abstraction for handling file storage in Django. It allows saving, retrieving, and deleting files using the default storage backend configured in settings.py.

MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

MEDIA_ROOT is related to default_storage because Django's default file storage system uses MEDIA_ROOT as the location to store uploaded media files unless another storage backend is configured.

When you save a file using default_storage.save(), it gets stored in MEDIA_ROOT by default.

saved_path = default_storage.save(file_path, ContentFile(poster.read()))

This line saves an uploaded file to the default storage system (usually in MEDIA_ROOT).

Breakdown:
poster.read(): Reads the file content.
ContentFile(poster.read()): Wraps the content in a file-like object.
default_storage.save(file_path, ContentFile(poster.read())): Saves the file at the specified file_path.

EmailMultiAlternatives is used to send emails with both plain text and HTML content, allowing email clients to display the appropriate format.

Decorators in Python are used to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code. They are often used for:

Authorization (@login_required) – Restrict access to authenticated users.
Logging – Automatically log function calls.
Timing – Measure execution time of functions.
Caching – Store function results to improve performance.
Validation – Pre-process function inputs.
